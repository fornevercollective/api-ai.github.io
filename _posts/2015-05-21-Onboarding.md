You spend months developing a great app for users to fall in love with. You went the extra mile and made a Getting Started Tutorial to help onboard users. But then those overly anxious users skip the helpful tips, get lost in the options, and then complain that the app was too difficult to use or didn’t work properly.

When it comes to new, exciting technology, who has the patience to read through a tutorial? Our instincts are to explore first and ask later. So why not onboard new users with a they-ask-a-question-they-get-an-answer interface? Here’s what onboarding new users with a full voice interface looks like:

1)	Person asks app how to do X. We turn that into actionable data in the form of a JSON.

		
		resolvedQuery: “How do I create a new task”
		action: task.create.help
		parameters: { helpTopic: “new tasks” }


2) App tells person how to do X 

3) Person wants to know more, they ask.

Imagine: your user turns on their new device, they are greeted by a virtual assistant that allows for an interactive question and answer learning session. They ask just enough to get started and then they’re off – enjoying your creation! If they get stuck later on, that virtual assistant is always there to answer with how-to’s and tips.

The assistant can also be updated anytime to include more answers for updates and changes to the app or device. That way you never lose a user when adding new functionality or updating UX interfaces.

What’s the best part? You don’t have to imagine – the technology for an intuitive, affordable speech interface, for any app, device, or website, is here at api.ai.
