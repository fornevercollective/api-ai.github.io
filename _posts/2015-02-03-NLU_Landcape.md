Understanding the basics…
 
Natural Language Understanding (NLU), worth having, can be attained with a short list: years of engineering power, data to implement, and, oh yes, money. Add to that the technology’s dependence on advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and this project is going to need substantial resources. No cup of tea for the average start up.
 
Your first thought when adding voice to your solution is, “We’ll just need speech recognition.” That’s true – you will. The laborious challenge that is speech recognition will be the basic component of adding speech interface – and it’s not even the most complicated one. Translating speech into text without meaning will only make you popular among those who derive pleasure from screaming specific voice commands at their cars and phones. Most people hate doing this.
 
After you conquer speech-to-text, the application or device needs to understand the request before finally taking action on it -- but how?
 
Getting acquainted with Wit.ai’s competition…
 
That is exactly where NLU comes in – turning text into actionable data by adding meaning. Luckily, access to that advanced technology is available at your fingertips and is applicable to any device using api.ai. This solution offers you all of this in a neatly structured JSON object.
 
Speaktoit’s [Assistant](http://assistant.ai) launched about 6 months before Apple’s Siri, making it the first conversation-based assistant available. As the largest, independent app of its kind, Assistant boasts over 16+ million users and availability in 12 languages – all powered by…. api.ai.
 
This means that not only does api.ai have an enormous engine behind it that has been in development for almost half a decade, but also that engine has processed BILLIONS of requests resulting in massive amounts of data to work with. With a solution as robust and flexible as api.ai, any app or device can have a speech interface that supports context and conversation with the user.
 
Summing up the tagline…
 
With the heavy lifting out of the way, it is now a matter of inculcating the importance and utter necessity of NLU. Facebook will be the first of many, large companies who want access and as the interest grows, so will the capabilities behind the technology. Watch out NLU – you’re on the brink of one epic explosion.
