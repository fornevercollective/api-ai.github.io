There’s a word for having a remote control for every possible electronic in your life -- convenient. Whether you’re settling down to finish some work or tucked in for the night, remote controls add even more convenience to the technology they’re paired with. Until you lose them, their batteries die, or one system requires 3+ remotes just to turn it on. Remotes were the solution for the 20th century, but now we have something better: speech interface.
	
What could be simpler than saying what you want to happen and then it happening? Let’s look at the - inevitable - smart home use case. We like the different control panels and various apps for each type of appliance we want to control, but what we would love, what would thrill our socks off, is to just say, “turn off the lights and lock the doors,” from our beds. 

This is not a science fiction pitch for future generations. You can enjoy this first-class service today with products like the Ubi and Smarter Shade. Imagine walking into your home and saying, “Turn off the garage light, preheat the oven to 375, and turn on the SF Giants game,” and having the relevant electronics comply with your requests. Speech interface is beyond convenient -- it’s efficient and offers a whole new peace of mind.
