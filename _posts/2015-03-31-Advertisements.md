## Why not interact with advertisements?


Do you remember the “olden days” when we had to watch TV commercials? We zoned out during irrelevant radio promos, muted Spotify blurbs, and desperately pressed “skip” to YouTube ads. Oh wait – it’s still that way.  Digital advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry and yet it is in need of some top-notch innovation.  They really haven’t had many options, until now...

Modern advertising is on the brink of a revolution.  It will leverage both big data and cutting edge technology to provide a personalized ad experience that was previously unimaginable.  Advertising can now be updated dynamically to reflect your preferences and interact with you as if you were, well, a human.  

Let’s look at a few use cases through something like Spotify.  

	Ad: “Hi Mike! I noticed that your mom’s birthday is around the corner.  She might enjoy a dozen hot pink roses.  Would you like me to send her some?”
    
	Mike: “Oh, I forgot.  Please send her two dozen white roses.”
    
	Ad: “Sure thing.  $62 will be charged to your credit card on file.”

	Ad: “The summer is creeping up and I have some hot deals specifically for you, Mike.  Would you like to hear more?”
	
    Mike: “Are there any flight to Hawaii deals?”

	Ad: “Let me look. Yes, I have a deal for a flight to Maui during the first week of June.  Would you like to book it now or should I send you an email with the details?”
	Mike: Send me an email.

	Ad: “Hi Mike, Geico can save you 15% in under 15 minutes. If you would like to hear more about how to save on your auto insurance by switching to Geico, just ask”
	
    (Later that day)

	Mike: “Can you tell me more about the Geico deal from earlier?”
	
    Ad: “Sure…Let me connect you to a Geico representative to find a plan that’s best for you”
